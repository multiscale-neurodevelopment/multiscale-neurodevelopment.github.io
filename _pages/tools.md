# Tools

We're focused on creating neuroanatomical models that can be used across neuroscience. This often entails developing approaches that enable data-driven analysis of brain organisation. In the following section, you'll find descriptions and links to utilities and tools that we've developed.

**CortPro.** Depth-wise variations in image intensity can reveal architectonic differences across the cortex. We developed and validated a standardised procedure to generate microstructure profiles using either post mortem stained tissue or MRI. Our approach is simply wrapped as one lline of code via [CortPro](https://github.com/caseypaquola/CortPro).

**BigBrainWarp.** BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers an ultra-high-resolution (20µm) volumetric reconstruction of a sliced and stained post-mortem human brain (Amunts et al. 2013). BigBrainWarp aims to enable integration of BigBrain with neuroimaging and other neurobiological modalities, helping a wide range of neuroscientists to utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain for multi-scale neuroscientific discovery. The toolbox is open and includes (i) histological features and pre-transformed maps in BigBrain and imaging spaces, (ii) codes for performing data transformations and (iii) extensive tutorials. Toolbox functions and tutorials are documented on [readthedocs](https://bigbrainwarp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We've updated and ported all the key tools from previous work into BigBrainWarp [github](https://github.com/caseypaquola/BigBrainWarp).
