- title: "Closing the mechanistic gap: the value of microarchitecture in understanding cognitive networks"
  image: TICS.png
  description: Contemporary research linking spatial patterns of neural activity to psychological constructs describes 'where' hypothesised functions occur, but not 'how' these regions contribute to cognition. This perspective highlights emerging insights into how microarchitecture can constrain network accounts of human cognition.

- title: "The BigBrainWarp toolbox for integration of BigBrain 3D histology with multimodal neuroimaging"
  image: BBW.png
  description: Neuroimaging stands to benefit from emerging ultrahigh-resolution 3D histological atlases of the human brain; the first of which is 'BigBrain'. Here, we review recent methodological advances for the integration of BigBrain with multi-modal neuroimaging and introduce a toolbox, 'BigBrainWarp', that combines these developments. See more on the Tools page.

- title: "Convergence of cortical types and functional motifs in the mesiotemporal lobe"
  image: MTL.png
  description: The mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) is implicated in many cognitive processes, is compromised in numerous brain disorders, and exhibits a gradual cytoarchitectural transition from six-layered parahippocampal isocortex to three-layered hippocampal allocortex. Leveraging an ultra-high-resolution histological reconstruction of a human brain, our study showed that the dominant axis of MTL cytoarchitectural differentiation follows the iso-to-allocortical transition and depth-specific variations in neuronal density. Our findings establish that the combination of micro- and macrostructural features allow the MTL to represent dominant motifs of whole-brain functional organisation.

- title: "A multi-scale cortical wiring space links cellular architecture, functional dynamics and hierarchies in humans"
  image: DeepEmbedding.png
  description: The vast net of fibres within and underneath the cortex is optimised to support the convergence of different levels of brain organisation. Here, we propose a novel coordinate system of the human cortex based on an advanced model of its connectivity. Our approach is inspired by seminal, but so far largely neglected models of cortico–cortical wiring established by postmortem anatomical studies and capitalises on cutting-edge in vivo neuroimaging and machine learning. Our results advance our understanding of how cell-specific neurobiological gradients produce a hierarchical cortical wiring scheme that is concordant with increasing functional sophistication of human brain organisation.

- title: "Microstructural and functional gradients are increasingly dissociated in transmodal cortices"
  image: Gradients.png
  description: We developed a novel approach to model the similarity of microstructural profiles sampled in the direction of cortical columns. Our approach was initially formulated based on an ultra-high–resolution 3D histological reconstruction of an entire human brain and then translated to myelin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in a large cohort of healthy adults. This novel method identified a system-level gradient of microstructural differentiation traversing from primary sensory to limbic regions that followed shifts in laminar differentiation and cytoarchitectural complexity.
